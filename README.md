Hey! 

Check out my contratian trading strategy - which tests if the market has indeed overracted for the worst and best performing stocks. I have personally made money from executing such trades in the past, whenever say Elon Musk says something controversial (which causes the TSLA share prices to tank), or when Apple launches a new product! 

Therefore, I figured I should first code a trading bot, which shorts the 3 worst performing stocks in the Dow Jones Index, and longs the 3 best performing ones. 

This utilises the Interactive Brokers API, which allows for automated daily trading!
